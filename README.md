# Dynamic-Website
Online tennis class booking system using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL on a XAMP platform 

The website is designed as a three tiered website using HTML, CSS and Javascript on the client tier; 
PHP on the application tier; and MySQL on the data tier. 
The website allows a guest register as a user on the site, and then book tennis classes made available 
on the site. A registered user has access to their own member page that keeps track of and shows them
their current bookings. 

Install
The host computer must have the XAMPP package installed and be fully functioning. 
The D13123922.zip file must be unzipped and saved in the htdocs folder contained in XAMPP. 
The next step must be to upload my database to MySQL using phpMyAdmin. 
This can be achieved in several ways but the way I chose to detail is:
1.	Open XAMPP and “Start” running the MySQL service
2.	Run the link http://localhost/phpmyadmin from your browser of choice
3.	Select “Import” from the menu bar and then browse to my database schema file, “db.sql”, contained within the D13123922 file now in htdocs
4.	Scroll to the bottom of the page and click “GO” to start the import

After the database schema has been successfully installed the website should be fully functioning. To commence testing of the website:
1.	Open XAMPP and ensure that the “Apache” and “MySQL” services are running
2.	Run the link http://localhost/D13123922/index.php to open up the home page
3.	Commence browsing
